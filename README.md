Lyrics:

### Chocolate #

  The thing you want
  Well baby you can bet it
  Ain't gonna come
  Until you go and get it
  We try and try
  We dont know where we're headed
  The thing you fear
  You've got to forget it
  Oh Oh Oh Oh
  Shadow-free vision
  Shadow-free

### Ice Show #

  You live, you die
  A needle, your eye
  An Ice Show, an Ice Show
  An Ice Show, an nice Show
  The Tech Noir style
  Versace, Bud Light
  An Ice Show, an Ice Show
  An Ice Show, an nice Show
  You live, you die
  A needle in your motherfucking eye
  An Ice Show, an Ice Show
  An Ice Show, an nice Show
  I'm a good guy
  A tse tse fly
  An Ice Show, an Ice Show
  An a nice Show, if you die slow

### Foam Home #

  Whose side did you sleep on, whose side?                                 
  And I drank no Pepsi Coke                                                
  And I  see your little joke                                              
  Yu all have been chased up and down                                      
  The other girls have left town
  I hope what you've got to do
  It can be enjoyed by two
  And it's lonely, whose side did you sleep on, whose side?  

  Don’t care too much for the wine
  The grapes rotted on the vine
  Not been for cotton-eye Joe
  Been married long time ago

  You think you remember me?
  You have a good memory.
  To get you to be my friend
  I tried again and again
  I can’t let you leave my home
  I don’t want to be alone
  If they come invade our hive
  I won’t go dead or alive
                                  
  Well that little game was fun
  I’ll show you another one
  Turn off the goddamn tv
  I get angry easily
  Laid out on the padded floor
  I don’t want it anymore
  The worryin ain’t worth it
  I’ll have to get rid of it
              
  advertize in lonely eyes                                                 
  this it comes as no surprise                                             
  sister, cousin and aunties                                               
  an inferno like dante's                                                  
  And it's lonely                                                          
  Swaying room the music starts                                            
  Strangers make the most of dark                                          
  Don't have no professors dome                                    
  When my honey bee ain't home                                             
  fuss with lovers, toil for kids                                          
  trot in g-string panties                                                 
  And it's lonely, whose side did you sleep on, whose side?                
  Early morning on the job                                                 
  We clocked in and swiped our fobs                                        
  Don't go to no private school                                            
  Pick a penny stubborn mule'                                              
  Work like devil for our pay
  Taught the children joined the fray
  And it's lonely, whose side did you sleep on, whose side?


### Beats Workin' #

  I see a road sunned with white sand                                      
  Wide plains surrounding silence and                                      
  I see a distance of black yews                                           
  Long as the history of jews                                              
  Far off, a broken collonnade                                             
  That overthrows the sun with shade                                       
  Beats Workin', Beats Workin'                                             
  Beets Workin', Beats Workin'                                             
  I see the gates of holy lands                                            
  A walled city, Jerusalem                                                 
  And I see a road sunned with white sand                                  
  Wide plains surrounding silence and                                      
  Far off, a broken collonnade                                             
  That overthrows the sun with shade                                       

  ...Shade Shade Shade Shade

  Waking up &
  Going out &
  Going home &
  Throwing up &
  Making out &    
  Passing out &
  Waking up &
  Feeling old &
  Days get short &
  Bones get cold &
  When they do you gotta know
  The wild life you counted on
  It beats workin
  But not for long
